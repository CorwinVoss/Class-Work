Create a program that asks the user for their age
then asks for the first letter of thier first name. 
The program should select a group for the user based on this input.
Group selections are as follows:
under 20 yrs old and first name starts with a vowel : group 1
under 20 yrs old and first name starts with a consonants : group 2
over and including 20 yrs old and first name starts with a vowel : group 3
over and including 20 yrs old and first name starts with a consonants : group 4

Your program should print out: "Your group number is: " followed by the appropriate number
Your program must also look for valid input for the age and first letter, and print out the appropriate error messages. (see messages below)
You may assume that the age input will be a valid number
You may assume only one character is present for the first letter input.
