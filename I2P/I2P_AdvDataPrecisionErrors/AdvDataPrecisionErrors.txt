Evaluate the following and use print statements to verify results.
What is the value of Var1,Var2,Var3 at the end of this code.  
Why does this happen?  What specifically is the cause of these errors?  
float Var1 = 1-3*(4/3.0f-1);
double Var2 = (12/11.0-1) *11;
float Var3 = .1f + .1f + .1f +.1f+.1f +.1f + .1f + .1f +.1f+.1f -1;

Ans:
Var1 = 0; Is wrong because it will never be 0 when there is a repeating decimal in a equation.
Var2 = 1; Is wrong because you cant put a repeating decimal in the code.
Var3 = 0; You cant have .1 in binary. so when you subtract 1 from 1f it would not be 1f because you cant actually have .1f in binary
