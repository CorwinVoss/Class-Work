Learning Objectives:
   -Learn how to use the protected private and public modifiers to change which files can see what methods/properties.

Secondary Objectives:
   -Review inheritance to know what methods each class can acess.


Assignment Description:

Fix the access modifiers so that they are as  restrictive as possible and satisfy the requirements below.
For each change that you make you will need to list it here and explain why you made the change.

-You should be able to create an object of each of the classes.
-The MakeSound method should not be able to be called besides by other methods in one of the derived classes.
-The DunkFaceInMilk method should only be available to the himalayan class.
-all other methods should be accessible everywhere
-the hasDrugs property of the GermanShepard class should be accessible in its class and its derived classes.
-all other properties should only be accessible in their class and not their derived classes


Example:
	1. Switched BostonTerrier Constructor to public because it needs to be able to be called from another file to create an object of the BostonTerrier Class
    2. Switched BeHappy to protected instead of private because it needs to be used in OrangeTabby
