/* Learning Objectives:
	-understand what Polymorphism is and how it allows the same function name behave differently based on the object's class.

	-be able to identify which version of a function will be ran in a variety of cases.
	-Identify which functions will be inherited in any given derived class.

For this assignment if you want to add all of the files to a project, you can create a new project and add existing files the project.  Let me know if you need help doing this.  However it is not needed to create a project for this assignment.

What do the following function calls print out for objects of the corresponding classes.
If the method does not exist for the class, say N/A.
